4	5.0  	Me encanto!! Muy buen precio. Buena calidad.
5	5.0  	Great bargain.
6	5.0  	The fire stick is so easy to use. I‚Äôm not good with technology but you made it simple ‚ù§Ô∏è I love it my 9 year old loves it too
7	5.0  	This 4K fire stick is very amazing best in the market. I would 100% recommend this. I am using two fire sticks right now one is 4k and other is 2 years old (version 1). I will take them in to buy 4k version. The picture is very crispy and it is much faster than older version.
8	1.0  	I believe I was sent a defective unit. It started glitching a few days after I received it and now I can‚Äôt watch anything.
9	3.0  	"I purchased a fire stick years ago, but decided to sell it because I wasn‚Äôt in love with it as much as everyone else made it out to be, but my friend that I sold it to, convinced me to give it another chance so I bought a new one. I haven‚Äôt used it much since I‚Äôve got it, but for some reason I have a hard to trying to download apps. But that could just be me. I‚Äôm going to get someone else to try it. Sometimes the remote doesn‚Äôt work. In the brochure, it gives you directions on what to do when the remote doesn‚Äôt work, like the makers of the fire stick know that it‚Äôs a problem, but they haven‚Äôt fixed it thoroughly yet, so I‚Äôm not sure about that."
10	2.0  	"What is clearly not advertised is that Dolby Atmos works only if you have a 4K TV. I have Denon AVR that supports Dolby Atmos pass through. Even after renting a 4k UHD movie, Atmos sound is downgraded DD+. Atmso was the only reason to buy this. Wouldn't recommend if you are after Atmos."
11	5.0  	4K has a much better refresh rate (stunning).
12	4.0  	"I had a regular firestick before but I just upgraded to 4k for better performance and it sure does have better performance than the regular one. No lag in streaming and voice is very responsive too. I took out one star from my review because it doesn't support some of the major streaming apps like VUDU and HBO Max. I was able to install them but had to go through hoops to do so, wish it just supported these apps out of the box."
13	5.0  	"It was an investment because my Xbox was being used as a streaming device. I know that is what it used for other than gaming, but I didn't want it to be used as a stream device. I have a smart a TV, but alot of its apps have been removed. So once again great buy"
14	5.0  	"Very reliable, fast streaming device."
15	5.0  	This fire-stick does the job it‚Äôs supposed to. I honestly don‚Äôt use the Alexa feature but had no choice since my old firestick had died and this was the only model offered.
16	5.0  	I love we only have to use the Fire Stick remoteüòä
17	5.0  	I‚Äôm a senior. We need these things to make life easier. Thanks

31	5.0  	The fire stick is so good I bought one for each of my TV‚Äôs ( 5 ) of them.
32	5.0  	It was all good
33	5.0  	Super fast.. great for streaming
34	5.0  	So much better than 1st Gen fs
35	5.0  	We've supplemented the limited list of apps from our BluRay player with this. Very easy to use. Wish we had 30 hours a day to watch!
36	5.0  	Quick & easy to set up!
37	5.0  	It‚Äôs magic.
38	5.0  	This is great. Love that it turns the tv on and off and volume so you only need this remote!!
39	5.0  	"We purchased the Fire Stick in order to use Dish Anywhere for our mountain cabin, it was easy to set up and works Awesome!! I will recommend to anyone needing an alternative to Satellite or Cable."
40	5.0  	It is easy to use and does what I need it to do
41	2.0  	Terribly disappointing. Poor stream quality and even more annoying is the 4k fire stick continuously loses connection to the remote. I have to unplug the power to the 4k ultra fire stick then plug it back in for it to connect to the remote. My next streaming device will be a roku.
42	5.0  	I‚Äôm still getting used to it
43	5.0  	Good 802.11 radio for flawless 4K streaming. Love it
44	5.0  	"Upgraded my COX subscription to Gigablast Panoramic for the best WIFI connection possible so there is absolutely no buffering on any App or channel selection.
My only complaint is the color gamut - the colors are somewhat subdued and less vibrant than my cable service with my new Sony Bravia TV!"
45	5.0  	I don't use Alexa but the 4K Firestick was simple to setup and it is used exclusively for finding and watching movies and past television shows. Everything works better than expected! Absolutely love it!
46	5.0  	"Sounds is deep , and has a nice bass that goes with a movie"
47	5.0  	It does everything I want it to do without problems.
48	5.0  	"We love it!!
Rarely have problems with it!"
49	5.0  	Better than expected.
50	5.0  	I really love the beautiful picture that I get on the TV while streaming with the Firestick TV 4HD with Alexa voice remote. It's very easy to use and the set up was easy as well. I plan to purchase another one for the first room.
51	5.0  	Even better than my original firestick.
52	5.0  	"This is a great product that will improve your TV experience especially if you have an older smart TV that doesn't have all the apps you need and/or can't add them. I have a Vizio 1080p from a few years ago and the processor inside is sluggish making surfing on You Tube and other apps a tedious process with it being so slow or not responding to the command at all. Forget all of that headache as the processor in this Firestick is much, much faster and you can select and start apps with no hesitation at all. You can easily add apps and the remote and voice recognition is straight forward with Alexa not picking up your voice at times, but not enough to be annoying, hence the 4 starts there. The stream quality is great and I don't even have a 4k TV and the picture is wonderful. I'm glad I made the investment in this product and it gets a big thumbs up from me!"
53	1.0  	Omg you have to pay for everything basically .stupid movies that already seen .I will not pay big price for movies
54	5.0  	No dislikes for tv
55	5.0  	"This is my first streaming device. I was impressed with the quality of the picture, the ease of set up. I can get Netflix with my satellite service, but the picture quality is better with the Fire Stick."
56	5.0  	Great product!
57	1.0  	I bought this in February. It‚Äôs July and the thing doesn‚Äôt work anymore.
58	5.0  	Best move I made in my life. You are able to control the TV shows and movies whenever you want to see the show. Being in control is the most important factor.
59	5.0  	"Love this, now I have Disney + and much more on my TV!!"
60	5.0  	Totally satisfied with this device. Have not used the voice control feature but I assume it works as well as every other features do. Has met all my requirements.
61	5.0  	I like it
62	5.0  	Funciona perfectamente para ver pel√≠culas y TV por internet. Se necesita una buena se√±al de internet
63	5.0  	I love it but it always gets lost in the blankets or misplaced somewhere. It would be nice if it glowed in the dark or if it had a light when you are in a dark room.
64	5.0  	The Great choose to pick from
65	5.0  	Performed as expected
66	5.0  	"This one is faster and loaded much faster! I love üíò it. The customer service is the best! At this time of corona virus self distancing the help came from India, the customer representatives were quick and efficient and took quick action to fix my problem with my last firestick. üòçüòéüòÜ"
67	5.0  	I like everything about da 4k firestick no problem
68	1.0  	Only had it for 4 months and it‚Äôs not working
69	5.0  	"Works well.
Not easy to get to work.
Had to call Amazon to help me set up.
Great picture"
70	5.0  	Very good
71	4.0  	overall was OK
72	5.0  	I bought this for when I travel. My wife and I went on vacation for two weeks and I took it with me. It was the first time I used it and it was very simple to get started. Loved it. Only thing you need to remember if you travel is to bring it home with you. I recommend this product for travel and home use. I bought one for my mother who has issues with remote controls. The voice command is her saving grace. She has no issues using it.
73	5.0  	I laughed I cried it changed my life. A new colossus. Evidence of a higher consciousness. You thought unlimited bread sticks was the height of stick culture well think again.
74	5.0  	Love this Firestick
75	4.0  	Will not work through surround receiver. Tried running through SS and the tv but does not work. Works perfect direct to TV but no surround sound
76	5.0  	"4K, voice activated with Alexa, what‚Äôs not to like? Great gadget! I especially liked the added Disney+ app!"
77	5.0  	"We canceled our cable over 7 years ago & have been strictly Netflix & starting last year Amazon Prime viewers. We do not have a smart TV so we need a device to link our internet to the TV. We have been using a Blur Ray DVD player with Amazon & Netflix loaded on it but that died a few weeks ago. I had heard of the Fire Stick before but didn't know much about it until my wife's nephew told me how it works. The Fire Stick is great & works much better than the Blu Ray & gives you so much more. I love that I can talk to the remote to run the TV or to just ask questions about anything. I now listen to Amazon Music through the TV when doing work around the house which is another great addition to my life & they play deep cuts of my favorite bands/artist not just the same stuff you always hear. I highly recommend the Fire Stick, you will not be disappointed"
78	5.0  	Perfect
79	5.0  	Excelente
80	5.0  	"Absolutely blows the Chromecast Ultra 4K out of the water. Amazing device, wicked fast, suuuper easy setup/use"
81	4.0  	works fine
82	5.0  	I‚Äôm about to cancel my cable so looking at Firestick TV to replace. So far so good.
83	3.0  	"We‚Äôve had issues with the fire stick dropping the stream. Overall, we‚Äôre not thrilled with this purchase."
84	5.0  	Lots of choices
85	5.0  	Like everything about it.
86	5.0  	Streaming
87	5.0  	The new Fire Stick has greatly improved the speed of the shows I watch. I never get any buffering.
88	5.0  	"I had the smaller fire stick but we were have trouble streaming.
Lots of shutting down or the spinning circle never uploading a show.
After reading many reviews I determined this would help and it did.
Now we will get one for the other TV."
89	5.0  	Love my Firestick so easy to set up and use!!!
90	5.0  	Great added Edition for the living room TV
91	5.0  	"Paired this with an Epson 2150 projector, and USB Power Adapter, and two 3rd Generation Echos to have a nearly cord free home cinema. Worth the price!"
92	1.0  	"This is the fourth Fire TV stick I have owned, prior ones were not 4K. All the others were great. This one will not allow you load any apps or APK‚Äôs. The others were fine."
93	5.0  	Wish we would have changed to a fire stick months ago. Love it!
94	5.0  	Set up was simple. It Works great. It supplements cable TV.
95	4.0  	"The only thing missing is the ability to view in list form...I hate thumbnails This thing is fully loaded with every stream you can imagine. We bought this to replace our blue ray for Netflix. There is soooooo many channels free plus ability to view network channels via our tv provider. In fact, there are too many to choose for me but hubby is in heaven. We loved it so much we bought a 2nd the day after the first arrived."
96	5.0  	Very easy to hook up great buy..
97	4.0  	I love it!
98	5.0  	"I own a fire box, and purchased this for my bedroom and it works amazing i can stream live tv with no lagging no buffering, crystal clear picture, love it!!!
joe b!!"
99	5.0  	My second ever Alexa device. In stuck at home during q-tine and ive got nothing to do. Me my echo dot and my newly acquired firestick have been spending so much quality time getting to know one another! In truly impressed with this thing!
100	5.0  	This is amazing. I'd order it 100 more times if I had that many not smart TVs that I want to be smart.
101	5.0  	"My Samsung Smart TV was clunky to use with streaming services, so I added this Amazon Firestick... now it works lightning fast and makes it easier to use."
102	5.0  	Very simple to navigate!
103	4.0  	For a older person was hard to get set-up !!!! Had to have a United tech. set it up !!! Big change !!!
104	5.0  	A lot of fun to use - once programmed. Certainly helps during the pandemic. Well worth the money.
105	4.0  	"well after a few hours, I was finally able to get it to work. I'm not electronically inclined.... but I learned :) now sit back and enjoy the telly."
106	5.0  	So easy
107	5.0  	"I dislike the series having to start from the beginning after being turned off overnight, instead of resuming where it left off."
108	5.0  	"I haven‚Äôt used it a whole lot, but when I have used it I‚Äôve been very happy with it. The Alexa command seems to work well. I am looking forward to some of the new shows and I did download Disney so I could watch Hamilton."
109	5.0  	Awesome
110	3.0  	"Sometimes is stuck. I have to turned off the t.v. with their own control. I though it was damaged the old one, but it's doing the same with the new Fire stick"
111	5.0  	Very happy with it.
112	5.0  	Easy set up plug and play
113	5.0  	I used it for speaking Netflix it's very easy to use.
114	5.0  	"Easy to use, easy navigation!"
115	5.0  	"I have a 56' Sony from 2006. Plugged in the Fire Stick, followed the prompts, adjusted the input, and just like that, I have apps. Watching Netflix, Hulu, Disney, and Youtube. Its a deal."
116	5.0  	I‚Äôm using the fire stick for my living room tv. I love that I no longer have to use my tv remote and the fire stick controls everything.
117	4.0  	I love everything about the fire stick except the battery compartment. For the life of me I could not get this open. I had to look on YouTube. Finally I found a video of a guy who had as much trouble as I did. He finally got it open with a glove with rubber gripies. That is how I had to open it. The back should not be that hard to open.
118	5.0  	Easy to use

Voice recognition is a bummer here. Device do understands what i have said even searches it but crashes immediately.
Over all i like the device but this issue fails it's highlighted feature.
From other features perspective I am happy with the device. Comes up quickly, searches well and helps find good content."
120	5.0  	Tv its fine
121	1.0  	I have not been able to navigate by remote or with voice. I go right to home and can get nowhere from there.
122	5.0  	"So far the product has been as advertised. I've only had it two weeks. I enjoy old, black and white tv shows and movies plus old cowboy and adventure movies. It feels like Saturday afternoon at the double feature again!"
123	5.0  	"Instruction in product description answered any concerns I had before I ordered it, so set up was easy. It was all I needed to update my older TV to get most/all streaming services."
124	5.0  	Simple to install. Had an older version. This one is way better.
125	5.0  	I wish I could have this before. No problems with streaming and picture quality is so much better. Get it.
126	5.0  	Not sure why we did not go this route before. Switched from a cable TV provider charging us monthly for what we paid for 3 Fire Sticks. LOVE these devices. Will now look to connect them to the Alexa in the room. BUT you do not need the Alexa for them to work on your TV. Thanks Amazon!
127	5.0  	I love this this is awesome
128	5.0  	Love it!
129	5.0  	Well thought out with a great assortment of channels makes this a real bargain. Fast with a great picture and flawless integration with the Prime/Alexa eco system couldn't be happier!
130	5.0  	What did I do without this! It integrated all my current sound systems and tv
131	5.0  	Very happy with this new Fire Stick! Ordered 2 so we could have on another TV too.
132	5.0  	Replaced my older firestick this is so much faster and no need for second remote. Loads almost instantly.
133	5.0  	Works great as advertised.
134	5.0  	The only thing is Netflix doesn't play sometimes I have to uninstall it
135	5.0  	This is a game changer for tv and movie viewing!
136	1.0  	The sound keeps dropping on any app. This is my second fire stick
137	5.0  	So great and convenient!! Love it!
138	5.0  	"I purchased this to replace my previous generation Fire Stick. I recently purchased an iPhone that offered free Apple TV+ and my old generation didn't support this application. I have been pleasantly surprised by this unit and some of the perks from the old one. It's super easy to set-up, it's plug-n-play like the other versions. I love the new remote design. It's a bit heftier in weight, which I like, but still compact like the previous ones. I also love that they've incorporated an on/off switch for the TV as well as alignment with my surround sound unit for volume. It sets this up automatically when you start the set-up of the device.
The negatives are minimal so far (I've had it for about a week). I have a Sony sound bar with a Sony TV. The soundbar can timeout from the Alexa remote. That means somehow the remote isn't fully functional to the wireless device. That's a bit disappointing since, I thought I could reduce having another remote out to watch TV. The voice recognition is spotty at times. It either can't find what I'm looking for or it just clicks on/off without responding. My house is an Amazon house, so I have Alexa with my Echo, Dots, Kindle and my phone. There can be overlap where Alexa can't decide which device you're talking to her on. I'm not sure if that's part of the issue here as well. I know there are settings to restrict which Alexa responds based on setting but it doesn't seem to work with the Fire Stick as well. The only other thing that was a bit of a pain was that I had to download apps again. Since this ties to my existing Amazon account and I have multiple Fire Sticks, it would have been nice if it recognized what I had already pre-loaded. Instead I had to search for the apps to download individually. I should mention that I have fully cut my cable. I use this Fire Stick to access the majors; Sling, Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+, etc. Other than that, I've been happy with it so far."
139	5.0  	I love my fire stick. This device is amazing
140	5.0  	Great product.
141	5.0  	"I like to watch Amazon Prime or Netflix, this is my first fire stick, and I only spent $26 that too for 4k.! Its easy to install and I am very satisfied with the results till now."
142	5.0  	Works well once we learned how to use it.
143	5.0  	This is my 3rd Firestick for our home. We love it !
144	5.0  	thank you
145	4.0  	"Had a hard time setting up Alexa on the FireStick and see no difference in the Firestick 4K as opposed to the regular Firestick , except price. Need to know how to get the most out of the 4k device."
146	5.0  	quick delivery. good product
147	5.0  	I love my amazon 4K quality is excellent I stream with little to no buffering picture quality is beautiful and I got it at 50% off so I‚Äôm a happy camper.
148	5.0  	Absolutely love this! Alexa volume control bigger! Love it!
149	4.0  	Sometimes video quality starts off blurry and then clears up. We have great internet so I know its the video. Alexa is sometimes glitchy and changes the video connection when commanded to find a show or movie. With prime I would have preferred more free movies.
150	4.0  	Just received and plugged in. As usual (and now expected) Amazon has all the bases covered making an easy transition from my last Fire Stick. Only question so far is why the Home button doesn‚Äôt go to the home screen. If that‚Äôs the worst thing.....
151	5.0  	Easy to use !
152	5.0  	I am really impressed with how quickly the Firestick 4k responds. The picture quality I am getting from it seems to me to be better than what I am getting from my cable channels. It was very easy to setup and has been a joy to use.
153	2.0  	"terrible integration, audio lags video- this is terrible"
154	5.0  	Easy installation
155	5.0  	Very good device. It‚Äôs much better what I had before vv
156	2.0  	"We purchased this on December 31, 2019 and it‚Äôs already crapping out. Alexa doesn‚Äôt understand what you say or just does what she wants now. Apps open but don‚Äôt work properly, have to reboot it often in hopes that it will work. Looks like amazon is going the way of apple and making products that don‚Äôt last so we have to constantly purchase new. We were purchasing new because we liked the new available options but we quit Apple because they went this way, we will quit amazon if they continue this way too."
157	1.0  	"Let me start off by saying that I am visually impaired. I do rely on the voice over features of many devices to help me in navigating those devices. I am not a huge fan of smart TV interfaces especially their built-in voice over features. They are laggy and somewhat clunky.
In my living room, I have a 4K TV with a 4K Apple TV hooked up to it. I bought another TV for the bedroom. Also 4K. Same brand as the living room TV. However, Apple TV 4K are expensive, so I figured I will go with a cheaper or alternative. The Amazon fire 4K fire stick was only $49.99. The picture quality look good. I‚Äôve also looked at some YouTube videos with tutorials and the build in voice over or as Amazon calls it voice view features.
When I bought the Amazon fire 4K stick, I of course understood that there is going to be a disparity as well in the perhaps operational quality of the product. Apple 4K is $179.99 new. Now, with Apple, the accessibility and the voiceover that is built into their devices to assist individuals with visual disabilities is incredible. It is smooth. It is seamless. It is a joy to operate.
Well, With the Amazon fire 4K TV stick, it is the complete opposite.
It is very clunky and it has a lot of lag. It‚Äôs putters all the time. It freezes all the time and randomly turns off or stops the voice view operation of the device because it encounters a technical issue. If I restart it, it‚Äôll start working again. But of course, that‚Äôs a pain.
I guess Amazon did not think about the fact that the device may be used by individuals with visual disabilities. This is an android-based operating system. I‚Äôm not sure why they couldn‚Äôt make the voice over or the voice view feature either equal to or better than even what apple has.
Overall the build quality and the presentation and the feel of the remote and the device are good. If the voice over or the voice view feature is turned off, the device is great. It‚Äôs a great cheap alternative to an Apple TV. And for many people, it will work seamlessly because they are not using voiceover or voice view.
No, of course, because I am reliant on voiceover or voice view, for me, the operation of the device is not that smooth. I am very disappointed with the product. I‚Äôve only had it for two days. I‚Äôm going to give it time. I will try to get used to it, but I might end up returning it and just spending $179.99 on an Apple TV 4K."
158	3.0  	"My remote has stopped working, i have changed the batteries, reset the stick and still nothing. I have purchased 3 firesticks and this one the remote has stopped."
159	5.0  	Hamilton
160	5.0  	"I am 100% satisfied with my purchase of the fire tv, made my old tv feel like brand new. It works well!"
161	5.0  	Why didn't we buy this sooner? We love it! It works with out television and powers and works with our volume control too!
162	4.0  	"Nice unit. Much (much!) better then streaming device built into our Sharp TV. Only grump I have is that I have not found a way to add apps other then through Amazon. We contribute to PBS and as such we are (I believe) entitled to access PBS streaming without a monthly charge. I have not found a way to do this with the Fire Stick.

163	4.0  	"Easy installation and use as well. Except buffering at some time, it is a must have if you do not have any cable subscription or you are on the basic feature as you get many shows you won't have before its installation. Although local channels are difficult to get, you can still watch such channels like abc, cbs and nbc but they broadcast from other states."
164	4.0  	like volume on remote
165	5.0  	Very nice better then roku
166	5.0  	"I received my 4K Fire Stick yesterday afternoon and was able to get it set up in a relatively short period of time. One issue, I want attach it to an HDMI cord, so I had to make a quick trip to my local Best Buy to get an HDMI coupler. I have my U-Verse feed all going through my home entertainment system, then to my TV and PS Gaming system. Thus the HDMI cord. I'm in my 70's and fortunately, my daughter and her husband, use Fire Stick. They were a big advocate for me getting one. They helped me over the phone (lots of face time due to COVID-19 and social distancing), with getting my first movie on Apple + to watch. Success was sweet, so I stayed up late to watch another movie on Amazon Prime. Streaming was great and watching the movies was even greater. What a thrilling Covid night!"
167	5.0  	Nice
168	5.0  	All my tv watching. So easy to use voice activated integration. Goes right to show you want. Brilliant device!
169	5.0  	Love the fire stick. I needed a wireless device in one of my bedroom. It turn out be better the my old Blu-ray player. I will buy another one for my kitchen.
170	5.0  	So easy to install and maneuver!
171	5.0  	We love the 4K fire stick!! We enjoy watching our favorite tv shows and movies!!!
172	4.0  	"We love this item, but they do not last that long. at some point, usually at about 2 years, they no longer function. Still, we love them for as long as they last. If we wait for a sale or other special offer, they are inexpensive.
The Fire TV Stick 4K streaming devices are certainly an upgrade from the old Nexus player which our son was attached to for several years. Ugh, that was truly hideous.
We choose not to use Alexa or voice recognition so have not rated those functions with any stars."
173	5.0  	response to voice commands excellent
174	5.0  	Great for kids easy to use
175	2.0  	"I‚Äôve owned this device less than a month and I can no longer connect to WiFi. I go to the networks settings page and it tells me my WiFi network is ‚Äòout of range‚Äô and when I click rescan it refreshes but no WiFi networks are available. I have multiple devices connect to my home network without issue and the rescan would have picked up my mobile hotspot or neighbors WiFi but nope. It doesn‚Äôt show me anything so I can no longer use it. Until they fix the bugs and make the interface more user friendly with less ads, I‚Äôll stick to Roku."
176	5.0  	This Firestick 4K has been great! I've had this for about 5months now. Everything runs very smooth without any issues. It is also much quicker than any previous Firestick I have owned.
177	5.0  	"Only thing since I used this stick the voice has not been on the same timing as the tv. Still working to fix it.
Tried once and still not right. I know it will be taken care off."
178	5.0  	Ease of use
179	3.0  	"Does not integrate with HBO Max, which is replacing HBO Go and HBO Now. Be aware of this since I only just found out late last month (June 2020). Fortunately, I also have Chromecast Ultra, so that honestly saved me from having to buy something else.
The audio processing on the TV stick is good, everything is dolby digital audio 5.1 (this that‚Äôs what my old receiver can decode). The processing speed is also better than the hd version of the stick and you can notice a slight improvement. Just keep in mind that HBO will NOT integrate with this, that should influence your buying decision if you like HBO content."
180	5.0  	Not enough storage space but other than that the stick is great
181	2.0  	ALEXAdoes not work cant understand no one calls us
182	5.0  	"Amazon for the WIN!!! What can I say negative about this. It‚Äôs a Firestick, hasn‚Äôt dissappointed me yet."
183	2.0  	The fire TV stick has a major malfunction. At least once a day the audio cuts out and the only way to restore it is to restart the stick. It has become VERY annoying. Plus the storage sucks due to bloatware that Amazon won't allow you to uninstall. I'm giving it 2 stars because other than that it works as it should.
184	5.0  	Shipped very fast. Thank you! Easy voice of Alexa in giving quick results. Love it. Thanks again for excellent service. Will have to get another one.
185	5.0  	Great fire stick loved these product can watch all my apps that we and my kids like
186	5.0  	"Great way to stream your favorite TV and movies at 4K quality! Does not lag, easy to use, fast, great for everyone!"
187	5.0  	"I have 3 fire sticks they all are working perfectly, the only downside is memory but they make other devices if you are app happy."
188	5.0  	I'm loving it I can watch my favorite shows sports movies everything no more cable for me
189	5.0  	It is perfect
190	5.0  	"This product is very, good, I like it very much!"
191	4.0  	Easy to set up apps are easy the up download works as advertised
192	5.0  	This is a really great product. I enjoy the easy setup too.
193	3.0  	If you want to play games on a Firestick I would suggest you get a Roku instead. The Firestick crashes frequently with games. However if you use it just to stream shows it works good
194	5.0  	"I like how easy it is to use, and how easy it is for my kids to use Alexa."
195	5.0  	My grandbabies love it
196	5.0  	Excelete compra
197	5.0  	Love it!!!
198	5.0  	love firestick
199	3.0  	"After one week it cuts out to rainbow screen for a few seconds and goes back. This is why I upgraded to 4k, because my old fire stick constantly did this and u have to keep rewinding the movie when this happens because the sound cuts out too. I want to return it but I gave my old one away. I'm just disappointed. My other firestick was refurbished and considered Amazon's Choice. So when I see products labeled Amazon's choice I steer clear but this one I didn't notice and bought it. The remote is the only thing different with the 4k firestick nothing else. I'm pissed!!"
200	5.0  	"Great product, easy to setup and to use..."
201	3.0  	"Since installing the new 4G firestick, I seem to have a big problem with my audio/video syncing with each other...
Any solutions for this would be appreciated!"
202	1.0  	Remote doesn‚Äôt wotk
203	2.0  	"buyer beware....you cannot get the spectrum app...sucks as thats the one app i need the most. other than that, it works great"
204	4.0  	"The Fire Stick 4K EZ to setup, and so far the Alexa Voice Remote works great."
205	5.0  	the best
206	5.0  	Great product!
207	5.0  	Very good product
208	5.0  	"The 4K version replaced our original Fire Stick, which would often buffer during streaming. No more buffering! It also provides audio controls and muting, plus the power button turns on the TV, separate sound system, and the Amazon Fire streaming service."
209	5.0  	Love it it works great. It is as I said a great product.
210	5.0  	Bought a new BenQ projector four our media room and couldn‚Äôt think of anything else to attach to my projector. Fire stick has never disappointed!
211	5.0  	i like my amzon 4k-tv stick .
212	5.0  	I like the convenience and the connectivity to view are streaming apps.
213	5.0  	Best ever love it...remote is cheap but system works great
214	5.0  	Just For Me... I‚Äôm waiting to see what else I can watch besides BET
215	5.0  	All good.
216	5.0  	Nothing it‚Äôs a good product.
217	5.0  	My smart TVs were buffering when streaming but no more with the Fire TV stick no buffering & the picture is perfect. Alexa works as advertised ---- you say what you are looking for & you got it just that fast
218	4.0  	All the features that it has it has to offer
219	5.0  	Amazing with my 4K TV. The picture quality is amazing
220	4.0  	Don't work any more turn off and on by himself. I run all the test including restarting and don't work.Tk
221	2.0  	"Hi, my quality in video isn't clear. Can I return for a better fire stick? Ms. Cassandra simon. The pictures are not clear."
222	5.0  	"Like everything, great product. Thank you"
223	4.0  	Great device for the price. Simple and easy setup I have a 9 month old baby that somehow triggered the factory settings do I had to set everything again. Not that long but frustrating.
224	5.0  	Love it perfect for my streaming
225	4.0  	Muy bueno
226	5.0  	"2nd Generation Fire TV Stick provides a more concise picture and added remote features.
I own 3 1st Gen Fire TV Sticks."
227	5.0  	Specifically bought it for NBC sports gold so I can watch premier league games. Goes well with my TV and a very good quality.
228	5.0  	Great
229	5.0  	Yes
230	1.0  	"I couldn‚Äôt find the app on my fire stick for the new HBO Max that will replace HBO Go on July 31. It took the better part of a half hour to stop getting the run around from Amazon support, and to get them to finally admit that fire stick does not support HBO Max. Seriously, a half hour. They must be getting this question a thousand times a day (literally) but they don‚Äôt want to answer it. Before finally admitting that they don‚Äôt support it, they referred me to my cable provider 5 or 6 times, which was nonsense. I currently get HBO Go On my Fire Stick based on my cable provider subscription. For some reason Amazon wants to hide the fact that Fire Stick won‚Äôt support HBO Max. Don‚Äôt be fooled."
231	5.0  	Good
232	5.0  	"So easy to set up, 9 yr old tv and this works great. Everything needed included even batteries. Very excited to eliminate cable bills."
233	5.0  	Fast processor and fast response time. 4K resolution and just what i needed for a tv stick. Couldn't ask for more for a 25$ discounted purchase!!!!!
234	5.0  	Streaming capability is improved when adding the Hard Wire adapter. Highly recommend that option if you have a network cable close enough.
235	5.0  	"I'm upset that I took so long to try fire tv. I was paying over $20 a month for basic channels for about a year. For $50 one time purchase, I have access to so many channels that provide up to date news, movies, tv shows etc.."
236	5.0  	Everything
237	5.0  	Like all of Fire tv
238	5.0  	Muy bueno
239	5.0  	The reason some of the scores are low is because I have not had a chance to fully learn how to properly work my fire stick but once I do I will definitely let y‚Äôall know
240	5.0  	I like it
241	5.0  	I am very happy
242	4.0  	Not as much variety. Ease of selecting movies shows should be laid out better then it really is.
243	5.0  	It's everything I expected and more.
244	1.0  	"I am having the constant reboot problem that several people in the ratings have mentioned. I tried to return the Stick and Amazon wont let me do a return. You fill out their form to return, you click on continue and the next action is to continue shopping and does not give any options but to talk to customer service. I don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone, just let me return the dam thing. It wont even do an exchange, which I wanted to do. This is the second Fire Stick 4K I‚Äôv bought in he last 2 months, the first one is working fine and has never rebooted in the middle of a video but the new one failed after 2 days of use.
What aggravates me is this the 4 time I have problems with Amazon shipping or with defective problems. Even after contacting Amazon I have received little or no help from Amazon Customer Service /Support."
245	4.0  	Still need some time to know what I dislike. Somewhat disappointed in the Apps and their limitations. Too many that are marketed to a much younger group.
246	5.0  	I love how easy it was to set up and how convenient it is to have everything together
247	5.0  	Good
248	5.0  	"This is awesome. I had trouble searching with the cable remote I was using before. Now, I just tell it what I want and it presents all the options I have given my subscriptions. You can rewind and forward the show with ease. Loved it so much I bought one for every tv."
249	5.0  	4K fire stick clearer picture/no more using second remote for volume and turning your tv off & on
250	5.0  	"Well it comes with a lot on PRIME, and I added some must haves and it works great like I never cut the cable. Still get 4K picture and I added over the air locals."
251	5.0  	"I love this Alexa. I use it to control my tv, fire tv, lights and music in my bedroom"
252	1.0  	"This product does nothing but constantly restart. I have attempted to get ahold of Amazon to report the problem but no results. I have three Firesticks and will be throwing them away as they too are starting to just restart themselves now as well. I was told one time by Amazon to reset my device (which I had numerous times) and that did work....for a few weeks. I wouldn‚Äôt think I would have to reset and relogin to all of my apps so many times a year. I am disappointed in not only the fire stick, but the ability to even get a hold of Amazon tech support."
253	5.0  	"I got this to replace my Roku. This device is faster then the old 1st gen Fire stick we own. It is more intuitive then the Roku. Plus Amazon allows you to sideload apps such as HBO Max. Stream quality is great. I love the control as it allows you to change the volume, mute, turn tv on/off, and even has a voice recognition that uses Alexa. Highly recommend it."
254	5.0  	Everything works great!
255	5.0  	Like the ability to access cable free shows online at my convenience
256	5.0  	"Made internet acquisition lightening fast, and improved picture!"
257	5.0  	"I was given this item as a gift at my request to use on a TV that does not have cable but only WIFI access and an antenna. It has performed quite well. I have not yet used the voice feature so cannot review that, but it was easy to install and program and I am very pleased with the quality of the item. I would definitely recommend this purchase. The streaming quality has been excellent, the picture clear and I found it easy to navigate with the remote."
258	3.0  	Nothing special
259	5.0  	Easy to install
260	5.0  	"The best to start and set-up, one easy remote to manage!!"
261	5.0  	This is the best streaming device you can buy fast and easy to use.
262	4.0  	I purchased the product w/o realizing that HBOMAX was not on their platform. Same deal with VUDU. Buyer's remorse. However the Firestick is an easy setup. Good signal - used both with wifi and ethernet adapter.
263	4.0  	Amazon and HBO need to work out a deal.
264	1.0  	"I received it yesterday and started watching Greyhound on Apple TV. After many iterations of setup, I've concluded that the 4K Fire TV Stick will not support Dolby Vision."
265	5.0  	"Finally, a TV that gives my 2 grandbaby girls a BIG TV in their own room....they love it."
266	1.0  	"I cannot set up my fire stick because I cannot reset my password and Amazon is no help. I have called 6 times, talked to 6 people, and nobody can help me or transfer me to somebody who can. VERY FRUSTRATING!"
267	5.0  	Easy to use. Simple to install. Better then cable!
268	5.0  	Good I enjoy it
269	2.0  	Product bought at Christmas as a present. June quit working. Would come on and then shut off after several minutes. Tried many things to fix it but would not work.
270	1.0  	"When t worked it was a very clear and bright picture. We have one of those window antennas and was ok with that, it‚Äôs an ultra 4K LG tv, but with Covid-19 shutdown we splurged and tried AT@T TV and you either have to purchase expensive extra box or a Fire stick to get it on bedroom tv.. and we ordered this and were amazed how much better Picture looked.. but then it stopped working not even a full 3
Months in, I want to return it but now I can‚Äôt find remote.."
271	5.0  	"The clarity, easy hook up, and user friendliness is excellent!! I do have some issue with the screen freezing and having to reboot the stick . . . Not sure why it is happening. Overall, I am enjoying it and have been recommending it to family & friends."
272	5.0  	Love this firestick
273	5.0  	The best thing that happen for me!
274	5.0  	Really like it. Very easy to connect
275	5.0  	Multiple viewing options!
276	5.0  	No more payments
277	5.0  	"Love this item I have had no problems
Video shows perfect"
278	5.0  	"Works great!
We got it for an older tv instead of getting a new one it now does what a smart tv would do"
279	5.0  	"Has more available apps such as YouTube TV, etc. Great updates and faster speed"
280	1.0  	The remote did not work at all tried paring it still not work after I followed the instructions. I had to use an App on my iphone to control my fire stick.
281	1.0  	"Ordered the New Fire Stick 4K... Supposed to be a plug and play... This TV is mounted in Master bedroom 9‚Äô up on wall. Ladder out and Installed as directed. Nothing came up on HDMI 3, which is where it is plugged in to the back of the TV. Called Technical Support. Re-Booted and it turned on. Tech support also told me that I should plug into HDMI 1. Why? I have Direct TV on HDMI 1, Apple TV on HDMI 2. While on phone, Fire Stick goes black again. Reboot again, climb ladder and rebooted for 2nd time. Comes back on. Then completed registration finally. Everything seemed good, and then hung up with tech support. Yep, turns black again. I start researching online. Apparently, the Fire Stick doesn‚Äôt like any other devices plugged into a TV. Call friend who has a Fire Stick, who told me to get, and he then tells me that they have to plug in Fire Stick and unplug other devices when they use. Then, if they want to use a different devise, they have to plug that in and unplug Fire Stick... Really? That‚Äôs just ridiculous.
So, on a TV mouthed up high on a wall, you have to get a ladder out and do this? No Way... Am returning this Awesome Fire Stick."
282	5.0  	Great picture quality and simple to use
283	1.0  	"Generally loved the product. When it worked. After less than 14 months, it just stopped working. Alex only worked for a couple of months. Yet, just frustrating it stopped working so quickly."
284	4.0  	My Samsung 4k smart TV didn't come with voice recognition built in. This now makes the device capable. It did what I expected.
285	5.0  	"I‚Äôm really pleased with the Firestick, I‚Äôm still navigating and learning how to use it. When I gain experience, it will be even better."
286	5.0  	"Frankly, I'm overwhelmed by all the program offerings as opposed to cable (there's no comparison). Picture quality is perfect. We watch a lot of programs on CBS which I never realized. I'm struggling with CBS All Access most of the time. Just found my local CBS station live; didn't think that was available. Slowly but surely, I'll get the hang of it. My husband is an entirely different matter, and there's no hope at all for my 96 yr old mother. But I'm loving it overall."
287	5.0  	"We had just bought are new 4K TV. With the 4K Fire Stick we have the best quality picture we have seen, outside of the movie theater.
Thank you Amazon."
288	5.0  	Really like!
289	5.0  	Works great.
290	5.0  	Great device
291	5.0  	Streaming movies
292	5.0  	This is a huge upgrade from the 1st generation Fire TV I had been using. Obviously upgrades in hardware made this faster and more responsive. And I like the addition of the power button (which synced with my TV after just a few clicks) as well as the volume controls. Would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their old fire or anyone looking for something to stream with.
293	5.0  	I love the product
294	5.0  	Excellent! Your engineering has come a long way
295	5.0  	Awesome
296	3.0  	Some times sound not machine to drama.
297	4.0  	The fire stick 4K streams great pictures and easy to use
298	5.0  	Awesome! Don‚Äôt regret it at all
299	5.0  	Great option to cable!
300	5.0  	"It is amazing, it‚Äôs very easy to install but I didn‚Äôt know that I couldn‚Äôt stream HBO MAX, it was very sad to not be able to watch a couple programs from that app, but it works fantastic!!"
301	5.0  	Absolutely love it I‚Äôm so happy I made this descion it‚Äôs way better than cable I will say that now I just need to buy a smart tv or possible fire tv
302	5.0  	"Very easy to setup and use, have been enjoying it very much."
303	5.0  	"It‚Äôs good, but in Westinghouse TV the control remote is not recognized. Volumen and turn on/ off isn‚Äôt available for that brand."
304	5.0  	"love the Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa built in, on point cross the board streaming*****"
305	5.0  	I use it on an older tv that does not have internet and my isp is very slow
306	1.0  	I paid $50 for the firestick 4K on the 5th. And for the last couple of weeks Amazon has it on sale for $25.!!! Feeling ripped off!
307	4.0  	Good
308	5.0  	Great picture on my Samsung QLED 70Q
309	5.0  	Great
310	1.0  	"The firestick ordered worked for 3 weeks. Tried changing the batteries ,that hasn't helped."
311	5.0  	I love everything
312	5.0  	Very good
313	5.0  	"fine,"
314	5.0  	"Master bedroom, I am still in the fave of learningow to operate it."
315	5.0  	"Much better interface than roku, Lg and Samsung. Smart tvs are such a waste of money."
316	5.0  	Yes.... I love it. I‚Äôm so excited about it.
317	5.0  	Love it
318	5.0  	"The best way to stream today, bar none."
319	5.0  	Easy to setup and use
320	1.0  	It‚Äôs really frustrating when you buy a $50 remote and it doesn‚Äôt work properly. We have had to reset it multiple times after only having it 24 hours. Not what I would expect for what we paid for it. We talked with customer service and it worked for a bit after that but then worked only for a short period of time before needing to be reset again. We are disappointed to say the least.
321	5.0  	To see live tv after cutting the cable cord. So far I like it. Easy to setup.
322	2.0  	"I just bought the 4k firestick about five months ago and I continuously get network errors or random disconnects. I have high speed internet and new router. No issues on my other devices. Amazon has to fix this. This will be my third firestick. I may have to go the Chinese route and buy one of their android boxes. Better speeds, better quality and huge storage plus additions."

327	5.0  	Much faster than older version
328	5.0  	"Nothing at this time, thanks."
329	5.0  	I do not use voice recognition or alexa integration. The picture is stunningly clear. Also navigating on the fire is very user friendly. I am very happy w/ this choice. I was using roku prior to this.

349	5.0  	Great
350	5.0  	I like the fact that it saved me from getting our tv fixed

362	5.0  	"I use it to get apps on my tv that I cannot get through comcast or any other way as my smart tv is too old to have the newest apps--like disney + or apple+.
It's great and easier to use than going through my cable service"
363	5.0  	The best cheap streaming device
364	5.0  	Everything as advertised. Very happy with it. Also took it on vacation and used it on the tv in the condo which only had basic cable.
365	5.0  	Love it and haven‚Äôt even used the voice recognition yet
366	5.0  	"Great, runs super fast and does not bog down like the original fire stick"
367	5.0  	i use it all the time. i no longer use my direct tv. my favorite thing ever
368	5.0  	Love the speed of the processor in the 4K Firestick !
369	5.0  	"It offers the best of both worlds: best price, best service."
370	5.0  	The user friendly setup was great. I ordered this device to install Disney Plus and was also introduced to apps that I was unaware of.
371	5.0  	I don‚Äôt have Alexa but have really enjoyed the movies and programs offered. For budget reason I cut off my expensive cable bill went to antenna I purchased at amazon also and I‚Äôm saving money. I really enjoy the fire stick I would recommend it to everyone.
372	5.0  	Great product..
373	5.0  	Thrilled that my daughter bought this for me as now I can watch Amazon. It works great!!!
374	5.0  	Great to have

376	5.0  	The addition of this to my growing Alexa collection was very easy and painless.
377	5.0  	This fire stick is great.
378	5.0  	Very clear.
379	5.0  	It was easy to install and we‚Äôve enjoyed many hours of viewing pleasure.
380	5.0  	I like very much.
381	5.0  	You can do a lot with these things. They‚Äôre worth it. Don‚Äôt even need to jail break it. Check out what you can download.
382	5.0  	absolutely love my firestick
383	5.0  	So much faster than the original fire stick. Never buffers or drops the WiFi.
384	5.0  	üëçüèΩ
385	5.0  	I‚Äôm happy with that is good enough
386	4.0  	"I like this new Fire Stick that I recently purchased and I was very pleased with its streaming ability the first two nights. Then it started freezing every night, where I had to unplug it and reboot it. I thought sure I had I now had streaming without any dragging, but rebooting is actually worse. Hoping this will correct itself."
387	5.0  	"Arrived quick, easy to set up, functions as expected."
388	5.0  	Not enough 4K shows or movies yet.
389	5.0  	Works great !
390	4.0  	My only regret is that there is not a one button record feature.
391	1.0  	I wish it was more like a regular remote. It was very frustrating and difficult to use.
392	5.0  	I love that now I only have to use one remote. Before I had to use one to turn it on or off or turn up the volume. Now one remote does it all!
393	5.0  	Perfect upgrade to go with our new 4K tv. I can definitely notice the difference between the HD and 4K.
394	5.0  	Bought to stream HULU. Easy hookup and connection.
395	5.0  	I‚Äôm very happy with my device
396	4.0  	I enjoy having this as much as I hate having an Alexa product in my household.
397	5.0  	Really like this better than I thought I would. It‚Äôs very responsive and super easy to set up. It works better than my Apple TV 4K. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is the ads at the tops of the menus and it seems to put amazon movies at the forefront and doesn‚Äôt give you as many options from other apps when searching. But because the menu is way more responsive than the appleTV I tend to be able to jump around in the apps much faster.
398	5.0  	I like finding new things on everyday are
399	5.0  	Love this product and have been using it every night. We have access to way more than we ever thought!
400	5.0  	It works excellent and I am able to turn on/off my tv with the fire stick
401	5.0  	"We have an older smart TV. Amazon Prime Video, Disney +, and other channels won't work, so we needed something to help. The Fire Stick is perfect and easy to set up. Took me literally 5 minutes and it was working."
402	5.0  	"I am not a very teckky person, but this is very to use.. love the voice control."
403	4.0  	"I really like how much faster this 4K stick is over the 2nd generation FireTV station that it replaced, but I think the most popular feature is being able to control volume and turning on/off the TV/receiver, Before I was using two remotes to do this."
404	5.0  	Love it
405	5.0  	Replacement for same model that lasted 3 years
406	5.0  	Does what it is supposed to do!!!!
407	5.0  	"The HD 4k Fire Stick is the best deal in streaming anywhere. This is not my first and probably not my last. The units are expandable, with a $2 cord you can add a SD card, USB drive or even a hard drive. With the play store and all the support videos on YouTube your abilities are almost endless. You can even take your pictures and show the on the TV. I guess I am dating myself but when I was young my father would setup the slide projector on a table, pull out the screen and set it up. I am just saying this item does so much for so little. A+"
408	5.0  	Able to stream apps that I use and like the update storage vs older Firestick
409	5.0  	Works great
410	5.0  	"The Fire Stick works well, easy to set up, great image. My only issue was I didn't look in the box close enough and I missed the fact that there was a small extension cable. The Fire Stick would not fit in the slot, so I went out and bought a 3 inch extension cable. If I would have looked in the box, I would have seen that one was already there.
I've yet to try to voice recognition."
411	4.0  	"Still learning all possibilities. So far, I like it."
412	5.0  	Great product loads of channels plenty of movies. Great while stuck indoors.
413	5.0  	Fast and easy
414	1.0  	Amazon Firestick 4K is NOT compatible with the Netflix app. It was working fine for an hour but then it tends to freeze. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. No resolution. Power cycles the firestick from the wall and disconnected it for an hour then plugged everything back in. Same situation...Netflix still freezes. Wasted money on this bloody thing. Highly disappointed
415	2.0  	"This purchase has been a waste of time and effort. The HDR feature doesn't work properly with this 4K Fire TV Stick. The UHD/4K/HDR video image comes in washed out and with muddy shadows. There is no way to defeat the HDR to avoid the bad image quality. I'm using a UHD/4K/HDR compatible Onkyo AV receiver and a UHD/4K/HDR compatible Sony LED television. I have an AppleTV 4K that is hooked up to the same system and HDR works perfectly. I need an application that my AppleTV doesn't offer, but the Fire TV Stick does. I spent 1.5 hours with Amazon customer service to finally be told to call Sony. The Sony television is not the problem. I will have to purchase a Roku instead."
416	5.0  	great in all functions
417	5.0  	Exactly what I expected
418	4.0  	"So far this device is working well, but the last one I purchased crapped out after just 2 weeks. So we'll see."
419	5.0  	seems faster than old firestick
420	1.0  	The remote keeps unpairing and its a pain to get it paired again very frustrating and without the remote you‚Äôre stuck.

425	5.0  	"I owe few online streaming devices out of all I love this product. This product has alot of benefits over the other products. Amazing picture quality, easy to use the remote control and navigating the content etc."
426	5.0  	Easy to connect & config. Works great
427	1.0  	"Do not delivet what you say you can
Disney does noy work"
428	5.0  	Like everything about it .Get a lot more video & old movies new ones to .Most of all don't have cable bill.
429	5.0  	"Very clear quality, great for streaming on all new apps like YouTube TV. Since we got rid of cable, it is Nice to have everything in one place."
430	5.0  	Functions as advertised
431	2.0  	"I'm a little disappointed I tried to up grade because I thought some of the apps were running slow on my old fire stick, turns out those apps just don't work well on this, cbs and HBO, hulu sometimes messed up, but not to the point i have to reset the fire stick to get it working, so if your using this to stream apps be careful it's not that great"
432	1.0  	"Don‚Äôt buy this. Amazon goes out of its way to keep you from watching anything.if you use a vpn. I have ExpressVPN, which is one of the better ones out there, and in fact Amazon sells them on their site. And yet, when I use the VPN, and then disconnect from it to watch prime videos, Amazon punishes me with a firestick that stops working. It gets stuck on connecting to network, even though my router shows that it is connected, and the only solution is to reset the device to factory defaults. So far this has happened to me twice, and each time you lose all your add-ons, all your personalization, and you have to start from scratch. I am disgusted by Amazon‚Äôs handling of this. And if you want to get customer support, guess what, you cannot email them. Unfortunately for me and some other people, using a phone or using chat is extremely difficult. Therefore as far as I‚Äôm concerned customer support services doesn‚Äôt even exist. I am buying a different device, and throwing this firestick frustration maker out in the garbage where it belongs."
433	4.0  	"It works, It's clear, it's still a computer and subject to the apps that may or may not behave perfectly."
434	5.0  	. The stream quality depends on how fast your internet. I have a fast internet and I have no problem with my Fire TV Stick 4K. Thank you!!!
435	1.0  	"Worst streaming device. Hardly works wont turn on or register in my HDMI, doesn't power on 95% of the time. Was excited to try but very disappointed. I tried other devices and my HDMI works just fine, its the device."
436	3.0  	"I've owned this for 6 months. The remote already stopped working. I replaced the batteries, nothing. It's the remote itself. It was not damaged or anything g crazy, literally worked one moment and then not the next!"
437	5.0  	"I had a 1st generation stick that was soooo slooooow. I thought it was my wifi signal because my router was very old and sometimes my phone wouldn't get great wifi either. Replaced that. Helped a little but hardly. I wasn't sure about getting a new stick because I was afraid it would be the same. The TV I use it for also isn't 4k. I plugged it in just now and OMG. Night and day difference. It actually responds when I click buttons on the remote. Like it is actually a functioning piece of technology. Amazing.
I got the 4k version so I could upgrade my TV in the future if I want. I don't use the voice recognition either. I live alone and just end up feeling like I'm talking to myself."
438	4.0  	Listening through my 2 Alexa Echo Studios and Sub. United at last! Nice remote upgrades from my old Fire Stick.
439	5.0  	"Got the 4K version even though I do not have a 4K TV. Why? Don't want to have to buy it twice if I upgrade the TV itself. Plugged into my old Samsung 46"" LCD TV (Model LN46A650A1FXZA). The fire stick set itself up, and works perfectly right out of the box. No issues at all. It's a snug fit in the side HDMI-4 port with out the HDMI extender, but it works, so I didn't need it. Apps install in a breeze. Only using standard apps, no hacker apps or free illegal streaming apps, proxies or vpn's. Just normal apps for access to legal streaming sites such as ABC, IMDB-TV, Netflix, Tubi, and more. Through voice, I can change the inputs on the TV. Just say ""HDMI ONE"", and it switches the TV. Controls TV's volume and power too. Have had absolute ZERO buffering via WiFi. That was a concern going in. Thought I might need the Ethernet Adapter....Nope, not in my case. Should have bought one of these a long time ago.. Highly recommended, and super easy to use."
440	5.0  	Love it even better with the volume control on stick. Highly recommend this
441	5.0  	all was good
442	1.0  	"This is more a commentary on follow-up services. We were victims of a flood in May of this year. We lost everything and our house is unlivable. We're now displaced in an apartment wondering if we can rebuild. Of course we lost our Amazon fire stick but I was hopeful because we had the 3-year protection plan and it was purchased in December 2018 that it could be replaced because the only luxury item we have at this time is a television. I know this isn't a typical situation but I thought we might get some leeway. The insurance company said that unless we could return the damaged fire stick there was nothing they could do about it. I explained that nobody had any idea where the fire stick was because we lost everything in our home. It did not matter. They suggested I contact Amazon to see if they could do anything. I contacted customer service and explained the situation including what the insurance company said and Amazon customer service said there was nothing they could do about it and that I should try to contact the insurance company again. I was hoping at least an offer of a discount but that was not forthcoming. Having lost everything, purchasing a new fire stick isn't top on the priority list but it was something that we hoped to have to take a little stress off during our down times. I have always given favorable reviews of Amazon and its products but was pretty disheartening by this situation. I know the situation does not fall neatly into a specific category or ""box"" but even Charter Spectrum (who listened when we said we lost everything) did not require return of their cable boxes when issuing us new equipment for the apartment we now stay at. I guess my expectations were just too high for a company that Amazon contracts with for insurance."

448	5.0  	I had a fire stick on another television so I already know that it works great. It is a reasonable cost to take a television which is not smart to a smart television. The vendor sent me the fire tv and it worked properly. I was happy with the transaction.

There is no help on Amazon for this problem, no email, no live chat"
489	5.0  	This is my second stick I had the first generation one before and I can say this one is much improved over the others. Also the remote with voice command is sweet and with the addition of the volume buttons it makes a vast improvement. The 4K also made a difference. Easy to use and install. I would surly recommend this to anyone

I have a INSINGNA TV HD, and It wasen't hooked up to internet cable nothing so I hooked it up to TV, Set It up went through the settings works and my internet isnt unlimited but still play's great, at first buffering slowing down after got going works better second day"
497	4.0  	"If you're upgrading from the non-4K 2nd-gen (""basic"") Fire Stick, with the original remote, the first thing you'll notice is that the new remote can control the power and volume on your TV and/or AV receiver -- a massive upgrade. The second thing you'll notice is how much smoother and quicker the on-screen controls respond to the remote's commands; really, the difference is not insignificant. The 4K Fire Stick is a pleasure to use compared to the often-sluggish basic version, in almost every way.
Since I'm still using a standard 1080p HDTV and not 4K I haven't yet noticed a difference in picture quality, but the big deal here is the audio -- a double-edged sword if there ever was one, if you have a multi-channel receiver and speaker setup and use a streaming app for live TV.
The 4K Fire Stick has different audio settings than the basic Fire Stick on which, under ""Audio,"" the sub-setting ""Dolby Digital Output"" can be set to (1) ""Dolby Digital Plus Automatic,"" (2) ""Dolby Digital Plus OFF,"" (3) ""Dolby Digital Plus over HDMI"" or (4) ""Dolby Digital over HDMI."" On the 4K Fire Stick, the sub-setting under ""Audio"" is ""Surround Sound"" which also has four settings: (1) ""Best Available,"" (2) ""Stereo,"" (3) ""Always Dolby Digital Plus"" and (4) ""Always Dolby Digital."" The following paragraph describes what happens with the 4K Fire Stick set to ""Best Available,"" compared to the basic Fire Stick set to ""Dolby Digital Plus Automatic,"" each of which is the default setting for the respective devices:
The 4K Fire Stick provides Dolby Digital Plus (""DD+"") audio to my new Denon A/V receiver on all of the major streaming apps that I use, including those that *don't* support DD+ on the basic Fire Stick such as Disney+ (another good reason to upgrade). But here's the double edge, and it really cuts: If you have a DD+ receiver with a multi-speaker surround setup, and use a live TV streaming app like YouTube TV which supports stereo only, you won't be able to use any of the surround-sound processing modes on your receiver (such as Dolby ProLogic II) because unlike the basic Fire Stick which outputs 2-channel PCM, this one sends a multi-channel signal to the receiver even though only 2 of the channels have any audio. You'll hear the left and right front speakers only; all the other channels will be dead.
The *only* way around this is to set the 4K Fire Stick to ""Always Dolby Digital."" At that setting, stereo sources will output in stereo as they should and thereby enable ProLogic and other processing modes, but DD+ from streaming apps that support it will be downgraded to Dolby Digital (""DD""), sacrificing the higher bitrate and resolution of DD+. In other words, you can either (1) give up surround sound processing for live TV streaming and settle for 2-channel stereo; (2) give up DD+ on Netflix, Prime, Disney+, &c. and settle for DD; or (3) go to the menu and change the aforementioned setting every time you switch between stereo and multi-channel content, to get the best audio possible from whatever you're about to watch.
Of course, if you don't use an A/V receiver with a multi-speaker surround setup (and/or don't use streaming for live TV or other stereo-only content) this won't affect you; if your receiver and speaker setup is 5.1 and not 7.1 or more, it won't affect you as much and you may not even be able to tell the difference between DD and DD+. (I've never used a sound bar, so I can't speak to those users.) But it seems there's always something with the audio output from these Fire TV devices; as noted above the basic Fire Stick doesn't support DD+ from some apps which the 4K Fire Stick does, but it also doesn't have this problem with stereo sources when set to ""Dolby Digital Plus Automatic."" Having just recently bought a new receiver to replace a 17-year-old non-HDMI DD/DTS receiver that couldn't decode DD from some apps streaming DD+ and, now, upgraded the basic Fire Stick to this device, I thought my audio problems were over but alas, they're not. Upgrading just meant trading one set of audio glitches/incompatibilities/shortcomings for another, which is quite frustrating.
This has been a known issue for at least two years according to the product forum, so obviously it's never going to be addressed let alone fixed. Again, if you don't use a multi-channel receiver and speaker setup this won't affect you, but if you do, and use a streaming app for live TV, just be wary of this issue before you buy."
498	5.0  	The fire stick is wonderful. I have used it continuously to watch shows that I could no get with my regular service or missed this year and many years ago. It is easy to setup and retrieving data is extremely easy.
499	5.0  	I liked that you can control the tv volume on the new fire stick easy to hookup
500	5.0  	I love this Fire Stick! I like the features that you can do with this. Roku doesn't have some of the features that Amazon does. I love the quality and the speed.
501	5.0  	Firestick 4k runs so much smoother than the previous versions
502	4.0  	"Works better than the one my kid had.
I will not be using alexa"
503	5.0  	I have Apple TV so I get some free movies. There are other apps that allow you to watch movies no charge. So having this only allows you to sign up with apps that you have to purchase to see movies.
504	5.0  	Awesome
505	4.0  	It is much useful to stream few of the apps directly
506	5.0  	"It was simple to install.I have three now. The couple in the next block (Medina) were having trouble installing theirs. Jeff Besos and his (first) wife were over there for dinner and he installed in 5 minutes. It is fast, clear and sharp. After the national news I watch only fire stick items."
507	5.0  	I love the Fire Stick 4K. This is my second Fire Stick 4K!
508	5.0  	I love this one better than the older ones. It controls my tv volume too so I don‚Äôt need my other remote. Highly recommend.
509	5.0  	Works like I hoped it would.
510	5.0  	We love our Fire Stick - super easy set up/install. Going to purchase for my mother who is in her 70s - she will love it!
511	5.0  	Love the new remote and the fire stick upgrade is great.
512	5.0  	Ok
513	5.0  	"Love the quality and non-buffering streaming. Great movie choices with Amazon Prime. Have it connected with ethernet cable with additional ethernet adapter, simple and works fantastic!"
514	1.0  	The problem I have is the remote I have is not the same remote as pictured and the cover for the remote is not the same. I have not used it yet.
515	1.0  	Unhappy about my purchase. Keep turns off every 10 mins
516	5.0  	It has fast reaction versus without it.
517	3.0  	The remote stopped working and it lags even with top tier wifi.
518	3.0  	I purchased it specifically to get the xfinity stream app. No where was it documented that the app does not work on the fire stick.
519	2.0  	"We bought this brand new less than a year ago and it stopped working. It was our second one, since our first only lasted 2 years. Only the power button works on it now. Very disappointed in the quality of these. A remote should last more than a year. The one for my TV works fine and it's 6 years old. This is so frustrating!"
520	5.0  	"I have a smart TV, but the wifi seemed to lose connection quite often, now with the Fire Stick don‚Äôt have that problem. Picture in 4K is amazing, just make sure that you have the bandwidth to support it. I have fiber at a 500 mb/s and it works fine."
521	5.0  	"Awesome product. Love the new remote with voice, mute and volumes."
522	3.0  	"4K content appears washed-out on my Samsung Series 7000 (model UNKU7000FXZA). Tried various combination of picture settings (brightness, contrast, sharpness, color, UHD color, etc.). Nothing improved 4K picture quality. Other people appear to also have this problem. The device works great on non-4K content. Voice recognition also worked well."
523	5.0  	"great quality picture, easy to use!!"
524	1.0  	"I called amazon and they refused to send me a new remote, the customer service rep told me I would have to buy a whole new remote for almost the same price as a new firestick."
525	5.0  	I'm very technologically impaired. It was fairly easy but with no instructions it took 3 days for me to be able to use it :/]
526	4.0  	I got it as a gift. Really good. Easy to use. Good quality.
527	5.0  	Set-Up was a little difficult - but is finally worked
528	3.0  	"I ordered the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K but did not realize until today I learned about the ""informer"" app. I downloaded it, opened it and the app told me I have the second generation standard Fire TV Stick. Someone somewhere pulled a switcheroo."
529	5.0  	I dont need cable anymore! This thing is the best!
530	5.0  	It has been great using the fire stick! My goal is to purchase two more! It would be nice to have buy get one free or half off! Thanks

532	5.0  	Love the voice and volume control. Great picture!
533	5.0  	The product works fine and is a nice upgrade for my older flat screen TV.
534	5.0  	We upgraded to the 4K. We are experiencing less buffering. Yeah!!
535	2.0  	The home button does not work!!!
536	5.0  	"We bought this product to replace Xfinity services and we are extremely pleased with the transition because it has similar functions, its cheaper, and easy to use!"
537	5.0  	I eliminated Spectrum cable TV with the fire stick.
538	5.0  	Ok
539	1.0  	"I bought a few of these when they were on sale because I knew I would be updating some TV's in my house. Once I bought a new tv for my bedroom, I tried to install it and it won't get past the first screen. I tried calling support but nothing helped, and they wouldn't exchange it because it was past the 30 day return. Extremely disappointed with Amazon service."
540	5.0  	None
541	1.0  	"I got my firestick to work, watched some programs,turned it off and never got the stick to work again. Tryed to contact assistance and couldn't get through. Still trying to contact the for replacement or assistance"
542	5.0  	My three tv‚Äôs
543	5.0  	It was easy to setup and image quality it's amazing

547	5.0  	"I haven‚Äôt been home that much , but the few times we sat down and used it (not really adapted to it to reap the benefits of having one) it works very nicely , beautiful picture and I‚Äôm sure that I Will be purchasing another on for my bedroom. We have dropped cable tv and are savings quite a bit by doing so . Friends have the firestick and love it , I Have already mentioned it to friends of ours as a worthwhile purchase . Thank you . ü§ó"
548	4.0  	Works great. Buffers a lot but more than likely do to att internet.
549	2.0  	We just did not like the small remote and no numbers to put in the channels.
